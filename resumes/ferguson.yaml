        Work with a small team of developers to create

        application.
      - >-
        Developed the Call Center application used by all of Technekes’
        call center employees with one other developer and a designer.
        The frontend makes cross domain API calls to multiple backend services.
        The Call Center specific backend provides a backend JSON API and
        utilizes PostgresSQL, MongoDB, and ElasticSearch. The Twilio API
        is used for Telephony via both VOIP (via the browser) and
        phone-to-phone calls. Twitter Bootstrap is used as a basis
        for design, though the UI is quite customized beyond
        Bootstrap’s default appearance.
      - >-
        Developed a Realtime Dashboard using Ember.js and Ruby on Rails
        to allow Call Center administrators to monitor the status of
        Call Center employees and listen in on ongoing calls.
        The dashboard uses Pubnub to push status updates from the server
        to the browser and Sidekiq for queuing status updates.
      - >-
        Developed an admin interface for reporting aggregate information
        related to the Call Center.

        for sending text messages via the Twilio API. Used the Savon gem
        for communicating with Eloqua’s SOAP based API.
      - >-
        Develop two separate versions of an Ember.js and Ruby on Rails
        application that allows users to upload a CSV file that contains
        marketing data, map it into a form that can be sent to the
        Connexio API and then parse the file and upload the data to the API.

        jobs using resque and redis.

        templating and communicated with our RESTful API.
      - >-
        Led development on a native Android version of Klikt that had
        several advanced features, including push notifications (for new
        deals and loyalty programs), Google Maps integration, and QR code
        scanning. Used Spring Android and Jackson java libraries for
        communicating with the RESTful API. Designed a mechanism for
